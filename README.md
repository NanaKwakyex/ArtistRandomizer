Future Development?

If Future development is done on this Projects First steps would be to make favorites page accessible from the start, and UI updates.

Plans in the next 100 days - Fixing the favorites tab, importing more artists, separating artist list by genre
Plans in the next 300 days - Allowing a genre search, Using a more dynamic API for getting artist data, allowing sample music for artist.

Ultimately, we hope to give the users the HarmoniQuest a place to explore the deep world of musicians.
